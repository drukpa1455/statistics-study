1. Introduction to R
   - Basic syntax and data types
   - Vectors, matrices, data frames, lists
   - Reading in data, basic operations, and data manipulation
   - Installing and loading packages
   - Seeking help and documentation

2. Descriptive Statistics
   - Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
   - Measures of dispersion (range, IQR, variance, std deviation, MAD)
   - Coefficient of variation
   - Quantiles and box plots
   - Visualizing univariate data (histograms, box plots, QQ plots, stem-and-leaf plots)
   - Dealing with outliers and missing data

3. Probability and Probability Distributions
   - Basic probability concepts (events, sample spaces, axioms)
   - Conditional probability and independence
   - Discrete vs continuous random variables
   - Expectation, variance, and standard deviation
   - Binomial, Poisson, Uniform, Exponential, and Normal distributions
   - Central Limit Theorem and its applications

4. Sampling and Estimation
   - Populations and samples
   - Sampling methods (random, stratified, cluster)
   - Sampling distributions (esp of sample mean)
   - Point estimates and confidence intervals for means, proportions, and variances
   - Sample size determination

5. Hypothesis Testing
   - Setting up null and alternative hypotheses
   - One and two-tailed tests
   - Test statistics, p-values, and statistical significance
   - Type I and II errors, power
   - t-tests for one and two samples (paired and independent)
   - Chi-square tests for categorical data
   - One and two-sample tests for proportions
   - One and two-sample tests for variances (F-test)

6. Comparing Groups
   - One-way and two-way ANOVA
   - Post-hoc comparisons (e.g., Tukey's HSD)
   - Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests (non-parametric alternatives)

7. Correlation and Regression
   - Scatter plots and correlation coefficients (Pearson and Spearman)
   - Simple and multiple linear regression
   - Inference for regression coefficients
   - Assessing model fit and assumptions
   - Polynomial and interaction terms

8. Visualizing Categorical Data
   - Bar charts and pie charts
   - Stacked and grouped bar charts
   - Mosaic plots and contingency tables
   - Segmented bar charts

9. Miscellaneous Topics
   - Transforming variables (e.g., log, square root)
   - Weighted means and proportions
   - Ranks and percentiles
   - Simulating data from different distributions
